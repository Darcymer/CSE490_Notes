Meeting Notes(Week 1):

We mainly went over the things that we will be doing and get up, including utilizing projects and github and how branches will work throughout the course. We also went over how our reflections will be utilized when returning things in . In short: things that we will be using in GitHub and how they work, as well as how canvas works in terms of what we need to turn in.

We proceeded to go through how our product is going to look and how we are going to develop our product (front end, middle, backend) and how we intend to go way deeper into our program to fully establish the product as our own.

We begin to brainstorm what project we watched to work on for the semester. We need ideas before, and we were assigned to think of features that we want to include in these ideas.

Meeting Notes (Week 2):

Remember, you can submit your work late (like before the end of the sprint).
